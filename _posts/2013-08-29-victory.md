description: This is our team’s fifteenth consecutive year as gold medalists. But
  at the end of the day, our job as coaches is not about developing better athletes,
  it’s about developing better people.

We’re both standing near the halfway mark; there is this somewhat secret spot on the rocks — you have to whack through a couple bushes and weave around a tree — that I like watching from. It’s a bit past the midway buoys where very few people sit, and is ideal as you can see the entire race course and get right down near the water. The start line is far away and difficult to see, but you can get a pretty good idea of it. Because of our angle though, we can’t really see the finish line, so if it’s close we wouldn’t be able to tell who won. We were both nervous this might be the case.

“Alright, here they go,” she muttered. More to herself than to me. She tends to do that. “C’mon guys!” She’s <span class="strike">cheer</span> yelling at them now, 300 metres away. As if they can fucking hear anything other than their own heartbeat and the thundering of waves around them.

They look good. I am not worried about their start, we almost always come out ahead. We spend so much time practicing our starts, it’s near impossible to mess it up. It seems this race is no exception, they look *really* good… but so do the others.

***

A race is pretty quick. Anywhere from two to two-and-a-half minutes. And they’re coming up quite fast, I know they are going to be close to the two minute mark, most definitely faster than their last race of two minutes and umpteen seconds. They’re definitely moving. Everyone is, as they should: this is the Final. Our second crew, our B team in Lane 5, is falling behind. I knew they would. Lanes 3 and 6, different crews from the same club, however, are right there with our boat.

They look good. Yeah, really good. Our last-minute drummer swap seems to be making a difference. Or maybe my seating changes. Or my reminders about technique. Or maybe they just got their head in the fucking game for the first time this weekend. Maybe it was my incessant berating: “I’m really not fucking happy with that last race, guys, and I know you aren’t either.”

I know I swear too much in front of them. I often flirt with that fine line between making a point and being inappropriate. I worry I might be driving it in to their heads that cursing is something totally fine for a fourteen year old to throw down casually because Coach is doing it. But there’s bigger, more important fish in these waters right now.

They look good. And then…

“Shit,” she says. My sentiments exactly.

They don’t look good. My turn: “fuck.” She repeats. “What the hell?” she asks aloud. Probably to herself again. I have no idea most of the time. We look at each other. I know what’s happening. It’s happened to me and my crew when I paddled. They’re panicking. They haven’t had a real competitor all weekend, and come this Final when they finally get another team actually competing with them, they freak out. The stroke rate goes up. The forget technique and about pulling hard with your back and driving down with your top hand. They hunch over and try using their biceps, as if opening a drawer.

The other coach, I know, isn’t going to be pleased with this performance if it continues like this…

I have the deepest respect for the main coach, an Olympic medal endowed superhuman. He taught me how to paddle well, he taught me how to better communicate, and he taught me how to work hard for things that are challenging. He helped me refine my leadership skills, and inspired me to help out my crewmates be the best that *they* could be.

I must have taught him something as well, or maybe he just saw potential in me when I didn’t. When I moved on from the paddling program several years ago, he asked me to take on a bigger challenge than moving up the ranks. He could have asked me to join another crew, another club, another national team.

Instead, he asked me to be a coach. I’ve been doing it every year in one form or another since.

I didn’t hesitate when he asked me again this again year to help out with the dragon boat team. This was going to be quite the year; more than 70 kids registered to paddle, enough for three dragon boats plus spares. That’s a shit tonne of hormonal teenagers to deal with. Many of them are brand new to the paddling program as well, and with the ice staying on the lake fairly late this year, we needed to move quickly.

Of course I would help.

I know a lot of these kids, and I’ve coached a lot of them in different disciplines. I’ve coached other paddling programs as well. I have a unique relationship with a few of them, shifting between friend and mentor. I think this is good, but it can at be difficult at times to know which position I should act in.

I like a lot of these kids too. I’ve hung out with some of them a while ago before they joined the paddling program. I can’t now — I don’t want to either. Our relationship is totally different. It is difficult to find the right balance of being friendly and disciplinary. What kind of coach do I want to be? I think it is important for people to like their coach; I want them to approach me if they have a question, a concern, or a comment. It’s easy to dance on the border of being frightening, it’s easy to tip over the edge and come across as a bully. People, especially kids, need to feel like they are in a safe environment, but I want them also to build their skills. I want them to build confidence.

They are right in front of us now, just passing the halfway mark. 300 metres in, 200 to go. I hear the steerswoman — this is her last dragon boat race with the program — call out for a series. And then the whole team erupts into chant as they count their strokes. This is hard: they’re out of breath, no doubt, and now have to yell.

I told them to do so, I figured it would help their timing and bring out some intensity. These kids are so timid it pains me. But they roar. And so does the dragon at the bow. They lurch forward.

They cross the finish line with more than a boat length to spare. Those watching at the finish line would only see a boat seemingly win without contest, but I know better.

She cheers loudly. I stay quiet, but I am happy. I am relieved. They pulled themselves together, they came through. Our other crew finished fourth — or maybe fifth. It doesn’t matter. They had a good time, they gained experience, and are one step closer to nabbing a spot on our **A** team in a couple years.

I love doing this. I don’t get paid to do it, nor do I want to. As a user experience designer, this is important: how can I make better products if I, myself, am not becoming a better person? As a coach, I need to learn from them so that they can learn from me.

“You swear a lot,” he says to me. His medal dangles from his neck, his shirt still soaked from the race an hour ago. “Makes you seem pretty scary… you look pretty scary when you’re mad.”

“You’re right, I do. Sometimes I need to though, as you guys just don’t seem to get it. Does it bother you?”

“No. I know you’re not actually scary. ”

“Well maybe I should find another method, yeah?”

“Maybe.”

“You’re not going to swear like I do, are you? That wouldn’t be cool. If you *need* to swear, by all means do so if it’s the right moment, but don’t do it just because I do.”

“That’s a weird thing to say. I don’t want to be you. I’m way cooler than you are.” He smiles. It’s true: he is. This is one cool kid.

I laugh.

This is the team’s fifteenth consecutive year as gold medalists in the Rio Tinto Alcan Dragon Boat Festival, the largest dragon boat festival in the world outside of Hong Kong. Fifteen fucking years. I paddled on this very team for five years back in the day, and now I am with them as a coach as they continue the legacy. The paddlers rotate every couple years. This team consists of the program’s most experienced paddlers, mostly Grade 11s and 12s. When they graduate highschool (or turn 19), they need to move up to the adult team. We cycle through paddlers, but they all leave with the same core values and skills.

At the end of the day, as coaches, our job is not about developing better athletes, it’s about developing better people. These kids are alright. They’re going to do great things.

*The Laoyam Eagles are an internationally-renowned competitive junior dragon boat team from Pemberton, Canada. They have competed and won in numerous World Championships across the globe, but more importantly, their paddling program has been a ground for fostering athleticism, teamwork, leadership, and respect amongst teens.*
