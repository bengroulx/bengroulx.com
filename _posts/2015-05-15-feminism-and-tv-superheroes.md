So last week, Saturday Night Live (with host Scarlett Johansson) asked, “Why hasn’t Marvel made a female-driven superhero movie, yet?” and gave us this piece:

Yesterday, <small>CBS</small> debuted the trailer for Supergirl, and my heart sank because not only was the SNL spoof accurate, it may as well have been deleted scenes.

Who is Supergirl for? Obviously the show is a cash-in on the superhero genre of television, playing off the success of the wave of other super-shows from the past couple years, such as Gotham, Marvel's Daredevil, Agent Carter, The Flash, Agents of <small>S.H.I.E.L.D.</small>, Arrow, and others. But who is the audience? Is it for superhero fans? No, because the tone of the trailer does nothing for fans of the genre. Is it “for women?” What, because a woman can only be interested in a show that plays off the sappy small-girl-in-a-big-city trope? So is it for people who are into “chick-flicks?” That would be my guess — which is a diminishing genre — because it definitely isn’t for those of us who just want to see a well-developed female superhero lead.

<small>CBS</small> has an amazing opportunity to present wonderfully developed heroines with just as much — if not more — struggle and conflict than their male counterparts. But nope, here we are, with yet another character and show oozing of banality and offensive displays. Surely there will be some to attribute its imminent failure to, “Well, I guess people just aren’t interested in female leads in action films.” Daenerys, Ripley, and — from what I hear — Imperator Furiosa would like a word with you.

Don’t give us “strong female characters.” I hate that term, as it implies the norm for a woman is weak. Give us clever, vain, insecure, conflicted, rude, courteous, abrasive, gentle characters with depth and conflicting ideals… you know, like a real person. Not this recycled garbage that does nothing to break the recursion. This shit is downright insolent.

I am not a woman, so I can only speak to the observations I have, and listening and trying to understand what my female friends and peers are saying. As creators of [Bitchpop Productions](http://bitchpopproductions.com/), [Tiarra and Athena](https://facebook.com/B.TCHPOPproductions/info?tab=page_owners) consistently note that creating compelling, interesting female characters that break the mould is of the utmost importance. I’m super excited to be a part of this with them, and hope other content-creators and production companies can follow suit.
