Pierre Trudeau once famously addressed the American people, saying, “Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.” And this is the most truth I’ve heard in politics for a long while.

The outcome of today’s election will have repercussions. The aftershocks will be felt globally, and yes that includes our own humble country. As my father has said to me on countless occasions, every action has consequences; whether positive or negative, this election will shape the USA and the world. As Canadians, how will this matter to us? Will we be greeted with progress and the bettering of the global community? Will our daily lives by improved in the short- and long-term?

Regardless of who is elected, I can only hope that they will lead their country — and the world that eagerly watches — into a prosperous, advancing time. We seem to have marked a line down in the sand regarding the two major candidates (remember, there are more running candidates as well that deserve recognition!) and their ideologies. Black and white. But this is not true. The entire fate of the country is not dependent on one person. I hope we have been exaggerating. I hope we have been playing heroes and villains, and that the worst from each candidate is misleading and overstated. I hope the candidates only want to improve the world by making the lives of everyone a little better. I hope.

Changes will not occur overnight. Changes will not happen in the presidential term of four years. This particular election will not change us or the world any more or any less than the previous election. Or the one prior to that. (I hope.) But, just like every past elections before, it will lay the foundations for the future. For the next struggle. Again, at least I hope so.

Maybe I shouldn’t care so deeply about the USA election today, at least not in such depth. It is not my country. I am a proud Canadian, and I will always cherish this country. We may have our own set of problems and issues, but Canada remains a glorious place to live and grow. I love it here. However, seeing as we live next to the beast, where every twitch and grunt has consequences for us, I feel as though I should care. I should at least be paying attention. Awareness is important. We all need to know what is happening.

This is not to say our decisions are dictated by our neighbours. We are extremely capable of forming our own opinions. We have had universal health care since 1966. Same-sex marriage has been legalized since 2005. We can push forward, and will continue to regardless of what path the USA takes. It may be easier or more difficult, I cannot say, but we will push on regardless.

Regarding this election, I have my own beliefs, my own opinions on various matters. There are many issues I hold dear to me about the current state of the USA. Marriage equality. Women’s rights. Climate change. If I were given the opportunity to vote today, I have already made a decision of which bubble I would fill. I would vote for progress. For improvement. For equality.

Our next election is in October of 2015. We will be given an opportunity to express one of our most significant rights as a citizen. We will be given the opportunity to make our collective voices heard and beliefs conveyed. Perhaps I am too naive about all of this. But I still choose to believe that we will work together to create a society of diversity yet fairness, rich in progress and heritage. I look forward to it. I look forward to a better future.

My American friends, please, go vote. Get out there and express yourself, make yourself heard. Every vote matters. This is really important.
