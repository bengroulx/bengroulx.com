## About Ben

I live downtown in Vancouver with my girlfriend and two cats, sport two large ampersand tattoos on my forearms, and I make my own cappuccinos at home. I am an avid fan of the Montréal Alouettes, fluently bilingual in English and French, and have a notable fascination for astronomy, typography, palæontology, film, and music.  My work days are generally spent in a small yet comfortable office surrounded by devices and monitors, books and periodicals, artwork and toys, while the majority of my time is allotted to writing emails, making to-do lists, sketching, and listening to a very eclectic library of music. If you are into gaming, feel free to add me on [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) and/or [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/bengroulx), both at ben(a)bengroulx(dot)com.

## How I Work

The following so much a <small>FAQ</small> as it is a possible conversation we might have with one another regarding working together.

##### “I’ve gone through your site but still don’t understand what you do…”
I make websites. Sometimes I design other things too.

##### “That’s it? Seems basic. What else can you do?”
Making websites is not basic. Web design and development (along with everything else that comes post-launch) have many processes and components that require a plethora of skills. In large companies, people have individual and tailored roles, each contributing by various means. I have fingers in many pots, as my skill set extends beyond just one aspect of website creation — I regularly update my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengroulx#profile-skills) with said skills. There are a great deal people who are far more knowledgeable and proficient in their respective skills than I, but I have a very intimate mastery of several areas, providing a well-rounded understanding of the numerous aspects of web and app creation.

##### “You work alone, then?”
I can work both individually or part of a team. It ultimately depends on what kind of project we are setting out to build.

##### “Okay, so how much will a website cost me?”
$28.43 after taxes.

##### “…really?”
No. Asking how much a website costs is like asking the same about a house. How many bedrooms is it? What is the square footage? What amenities does it have? Where is it located? These are all things that affect the total cost; web design is no different. We need to determine precisely what you need in order to accurately set a fair price. That said, note I will not take on a project below $1,200 per two week period.

##### “That’s expensive.”
To quote the elegant Mr. Monteiro, “Design is an investment in infrastructure and keeps the wheels of business running smoothly. Good design equals a more effective product or service. Design equals profit!” ([Design Is a Job, 2012](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job).) Good design involves considered approach and examined refinement to achieve success. Your product’s future requires investment; the design I do, and the work involved in it, provides tremendous insight. Your product will be better, and that in itself is a matter containing immense value and worth.

##### “But my nephew will make one for $50 and a six-pack.”
No he won’t. He will go buy and load up a template site then change the colours for you. Although to be fair, that is what $50 and a case of beer will get you; you get what you pay for. Building a quality website is a lengthy, complicated process that requires goal setting, strategy, sketching and wireframing, designing, programming / development, site testing, target audience testing, and refinement… among other tasks. By only paying $50 you are pegging design as inferior and failing to see the worth of the work and process that goes into it.

##### “We are a good cause, will you work for us for free?”
No. Unless you are a small non-profit group that I share values with, I do not work for free. See my (link: #ethic text: ethical statement).

##### “We’re short on money, can we offer other goods or services as trade?”
No. I can’t pay rent with your goods or services.

##### “This work will help build your portfolio, we shouldn’t have to pay.”
A student or young budding freelancer might be interested in building up their portfolio, and may offer to work for a very low cost, but by no means should they be unpaid.  By treating designers like you are offering them a favour, you are letting everyone know you do not value them or their work. See the nephew question above.

##### “We’re friends… can you do some work for me for free?”
No.

##### “But we’re friends.”
I doubt it. If we don’t drink beer together on a regular basis and discuss how great (link: http://steamworks.com/brewery/ text: Steamworks Pilsner) is, you aren’t getting free work. I am happy though to have you as a client and provide you with a contract and a quote for paid work.

##### “You sound like a jerk.”
Well that would depend on who you ask. I want to work with people and companies that care about what they do as much as I care about the work I do. Some things are more important than a job; when our values don’t align, we aren’t a good partnership.

##### “When can we start?”
It will depend on how busy I am at the moment and when you are available for project commitment. [Let’s connect](#connect) and go from there.

## Ethical Statement

#### Nonprofit
I am happy to work with non-profit organizations, providing they align with values I believe in. I can offer lower rates for large <small>NPO</small>s, and for small groups I have an alloted amount of days per month where I am happy to work pro-bono. (Again, provided our values align.)

#### Safety
I constantly stay up-to-date with web design, marketing, and development business to ensure that my work is following the best practices of the industry. I will never knowingly use strategies or tactics that put clients in harms way, and will do everything in my power to protect them from others that might.

#### Diversity
I will actively go seek out professional opportunities that include  a diverse group of people, including race, colour, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, and age. I would very much love to work with you! If you do not maintain the same view, we are not a good fit for working together.

#### Pursuit
I believe that designers are responsible for the work they put out into the world. I want my work to speak to the topics I hold dear. I would particularly love the opportunity to work with organizations that help <small>LGBT</small> youth, environmental concerns, or those dealing with cancer or depression / mental illness.

## Colophon

This site is built with [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com), a wonderfully simple, hassle-free content management simple that is “Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.” Boy, is it ever. My biggest dislike of CMSs is the way they lock you in to their system and methodologies. Kirby, however, allows me to focus on building modules and templates in a totally intuitive and non-intrusive way. I can’t thank [Bastian Allgeier](https://twitter.com/bastianallgeier) enough for the terrific product he has made, as it’s made my life *better.* Check it out.

This valid, semantic <small>HTML5</small> and <small>CSS3</small> code has been augmented with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), written with the aid of the awesome [Brackets](http://brackets.io) text editor on an Apple [iMac (21.5-inch)](http://apple.com/imac/). Other tools / services used during development were Pornel’s [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) compressor, Riot’s [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com) app, [Prepros](https://prepros.io/), [Photoshop](https://adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [MAMP,](https://mamp.info/en/) [Dropbox](http://db.tt/UcJiWAr), and [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?sig=44ace5a54bfead63c4100e39c6c88d3d&uid=40197877).

All typefaces used on this site are served via [Typekit](https://typekit.com/). Body copy is set in [Tablet Gothic](https://typekit.com/fonts/tablet-gothic), with headers and pull-text in [Ronnia](https://typekit.com/fonts/acta-display); both typefaces are created by the awesome [TypeTogether](https://typekit.com/foundries/typetogether) foundry. While stylistically similar, I find that the two complement each other well enough, especially when the font sizes are quite different. There are a couple splashes of [Futura PT](https://typekit.com/fonts/futura-pt) throughout as well.

Hosting is supplied by the impeccable service of [Lithium Hosting](http://lithiumhosting.com/billing/aff.php?aff=335). I’m not a back-end guy, so their services cover everything I need.

## Manifesto

##### Hear Me
I offer reactions, not answers. An answer implies there is but one constant result, which simply cannot provide a successful design outcome. There is no “perfect,” just “better.” I offer reactions; reactions with insight into how <span class="strike">users</span> your specific audience can make better use of your digital products and services.

##### Trust Me
Success requires faith. You have hired — or are looking to hire — an individual or organization to help create or improve your product. You are spending money, sometimes a lot, on evaluation, strategy, time, and resources that you cannot provide yourself. Trust the given expertise, and thoroughly take the recommendations into consideration. The initial desire does not often match the necessary conclusion, the one that helps.

##### Pay Me
Good design is not guessing, nor can it be done in twenty-two minutes. It involves considered approach and examined refinement to achieve success. Your product’s future requires investment; the design I do, and the work involved in it, provides tremendous insight. Your product will be *better*, and that in itself is a matter containing immense value and worth.

## Background

Once upon a time I studied social psychology at the University of Victoria and design at the Art Institute of Vancouver. Although I have a formal education (whatever that means), I wholly believe the classroom environment can only provide a certain portion of knowledge: school helped me expand my thinking attitude, but it does not define it. I’ve been working in the web industry for the better part of a decade, and since that time have been able to explore many subjects and areas of the design field. Although I am continuously learning — and forever will be — I am capable of providing expertise in various disciplines, notably…
