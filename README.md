##Colophon

This site is built on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and served up with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is maintained using [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/), a wonderfully simple, hassle-free content management “designed for a better web.” My biggest dislike of many CMSs is the way they lock you in to their system and methodologies. Siteleaf, coupled with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, however, allows me to focus on building components and templates in a totally intuitive and non-intrusive way. I can’t thank [Oak](http://oak.is/) enough for the terrific product they have made, as it’s made my life *better.* Check it out.

This valid, semantic <small>HTML5</small> and <small>CSS3</small> code has been augmented with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), written with the aid of the awesome [Atom](http://atom.io) text editor on an Apple [MacBook Pro with Retina Display (15-inch)](http://apple.com/macbook-pro/). Other tools and services used during development included [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com), [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/), [Photoshop](https://adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Dropbox](http://db.tt/UcJiWAr), and [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?sig=44ace5a54bfead63c4100e39c6c88d3d&uid=40197877).
Asset management is provided by the [Jekyll Assets](https://github.com/ixti/jekyll-assets) plugin.

All typefaces used on this site are served via [Typekit](https://typekit.com/). Body copy is set in [Tablet Gothic](https://typekit.com/fonts/tablet-gothic), with headers and pull-text in [Coranto 2](https://typekit.com/fonts/coranto-2) — both designed by the terrific [TypeTogether](https://typekit.com/foundries/typetogether) foundry.

Hosting is supplied by the impeccable service of [Lithium Hosting](http://lithiumhosting.com/billing/aff.php?aff=335). Databases and hosting drives me bananas, and their services cover everything I need.
