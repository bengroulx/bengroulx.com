Those are key. His talent, which becomes all the more apparent when he reaches out to share his knowledge and discuss design, is top notch. I have recommended Ben several times and will continue to do so.)

>(link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengroulx/#recommendations text: I worked with Ben at Custom Fit Online and even though we worked together virtually, we had great chemistry. He was always able to execute my ideas into beautiful graphics, teach me how to do technical things that I didn't know how to do and was always really positive. He's a talented man and if you get a chance to work with him you will see first hand.)
