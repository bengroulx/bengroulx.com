Many of the projects below were completed as part of a team working with (link: http://customfitonline.com text: Custom Fit Online), and the roles of others are included. My contributions and those of others are included within project descriptions.

## Archived Projects

The following projects are either completed long ago, and may not be representative of my latest skills, or are projects that are outside of my regular project type.


## More Projects

The following projects are work that I am excited about, however they haven’t had case studies built around them like the previous projects have. View them if the previous eight weren’t enough.

## Non-Shipped Projects

Sometimes, projects are started but not pushed into the real-world. There can be many reasons for this: maybe the client has decided to postpone redesigns, or maybe internal problems led to contract terminations. These project have not shipped, but I consider my role in them noteworthy, and I am proud of my contributions to the project, even if they weren’t selected as final products.
